# dc_mergeAeps
Merge identically-named folders inside of AE and preserve hierarchy.

This script for Adobe After Effects merges identically named folders inside of the project window. 
The idea of this script is to aid with merging projects, specificially two versions of the same project,
automatically consolidating folders.
